## Project 1 (Beginner Level): **Implement a Queue using a List**
**Concepts reinforced:** arrays/lists, abstract data type (queue), FIFO behavior, Big‑O reasoning.

### Requirements
1. Create a `Queue` class with the following methods:
   - `enqueue(element)` → adds an element to the back of the queue.  
   - `dequeue()` → removes and returns the front element.  
   - `is_empty()` → returns `True` if the queue is empty.  
   - `peek()` → returns the front element without removing it.  
2. Internally, use a Python list to store the elements.  
3. Demonstrate the queue by enqueuing a few items, dequeuing them, and printing results.  
4. Add a short comment in your code explaining the **time complexity** of each operation (`O(1)` or `O(n)` depending on how you implement it).
